# Laravel-Movie
This repsitory is a Movie website made with (A)-Laravel.  (_See what I did there?_)
<br>The goal of the website is to save as many movies as you like and to add new ones.

**On this website you can:**
- Add/save (watched) movies;
- Personally rate movies;
- Comment on your movies;
- Create a Watchlist;
- Share your Watchlist with friends (who also got an account);
- Make the computer pick a random movie from your list to watch it.

_And more..._

### Why I made this website:
When I go to the cinema to watch a movie, I always have to sit through the trailers.<br>
Some of these trailers are trailers of movies I would actually like to fully watch. <br>
So when I see a movie I would like, I save the name of that movie to watch it on another day.<br>

In other words... <br>
			_"My existence is filled with random notes of random movies I once upon a time really wanted to watch but completely forgot about"._

**So I created this website!**
<br>
A website where I can both collect all the movie-names of movies I would love to watch in the near future _**and**_ a collection of movies I have already watched, so I can re-see it if I want to.
